# FREEPII
Source code for FREEPII <br />
 <br />
To generate predicted PPIs, follow FREEPII_SEC2-heavy_cv1_example.ipynb in the code folder, and use MCL_Clusters.ipynb to generate predicted clusters. <br />
<br />
<br />
To evaluate model performance on PPI classification, follow code in Performance_PPI.R.
<br />
<br />
To measure the quality of predicted clusters, use GO_score.ipynb, CoLocalization_score_Complex.R, Composite_score_Complex.R in the code folder to calculate GOGO scores, co-localization scores, and composite scores. <br />
